Good Extensions to install:

1. Bracket Pair Colorizer - open and closing brackets will match color
2. Code Runner (make sure you have node installed too) - Helps run your code (good for JS too)
3. Code Spell Checker - Helps catch most spelling errors
4. indent-rainbow - gives color to the different levels as the code is indented
5. Jinja Snippets - For Flask (and django) will allow you to use emmett but for jinja (will explain this later)
6. Python - This will be asked to be installed by default when you open your first .py file

Optional Extensions:

1. Easy LESS - This is for styling with .less documents so that it converts it to .css
2. Prettier - Code formatter - Helps give some extra color to your code


A Fun extension:
1. Code Time - Lets you see how much you code (kinda scarry sometimes to see these numbers)


Themes:
I recommend a good theme that you can see everything well.
